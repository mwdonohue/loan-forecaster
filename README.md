# Loan Simulator (Title WIP)

I had roughly two primary motivations behind this project:

1. I have an unbelievable amount of outstanding student loan debt and I got tired of trying to use online tools that didn't quite do what I wanted (more on that later)
2. I wanted to get more experience using a frontend library/framework for a personal project.

Regarding the first point, there are a lot of calculators out there that will tell you what your monthly loan payments will be, given certain parameters.
The frustrating thing with these calculators is that there doesn't exist a single one that will answer the following question: "Given a monthly payment, what is the quickest I can pay off my loans and how long will that take?"
While I understand this is a big question, I was surprised to find out that a tool in which you give a dollar amount along with loan information did not exist.

Regarding the second point, I just wanted to pick up some new tooling skills during the summer.

Given these two points, I felt that it was appropriate to make this calculator using React.

The project isn't much as of right now, but essentially my end goal is to easily get an answer to the previous question.

I plan on deploying this some time in the future when I get it to a point where I am happy with how it looks and runs, but for now, you can just look at the code and run it locally.
